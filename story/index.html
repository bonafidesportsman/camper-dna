  <div class="article-body">
    <h2>It started with a spreadsheet</h2>
<p>Like most people who end up building a van, I started with a vague idea and a dangerous amount of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I knew I wanted to spend more time outdoors. I knew I wanted something that could do wild camping but wouldn't fall apart on a campsite. I knew I liked VW Transporters. Beyond that, I had no idea what I actually needed — and it turned out that not knowing what you need is the most expensive way to start this process.</p>
<p>The forums were full of opinions. The YouTube channels were full of sponsored content. The Facebook groups were full of contradictions. Everyone was helpful. Nobody was talking about my situation — because they didn't know what my situation was.</p>
<p>So I built a spreadsheet. Questions down one side, implications of each answer along the top. It was ugly and it took weeks, but by the end of it I had something that looked like a brief. And that brief turned into a van I've genuinely never regretted.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The conversation that started this site</h2>
<p>Somewhere around the third person who messaged me asking how I'd worked out my spec, I realised the spreadsheet was more useful than I'd thought.</p>
<p>Not just the output — the <em>process</em>. The act of answering structured questions in a particular order, understanding what each answer implied for the next decision, building up a picture of what you actually need rather than what sounds appealing on a forum. That process was the thing that made the difference.</p>
<p>CamperDNA is that process, rebuilt properly. The questions are better, the logic is cleaner, the output is clearer. But the idea is the same: start with you, not with a van.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What we're trying to do</h2>
<p>The campervan world is wonderful. The community is warm, the culture is generous, and waking up somewhere beautiful in a van built around your life is one of the better things going.</p>
<p>But the information landscape around it is a mess. Good advice is buried under bad advice. Independent voices are drowned out by commercial ones. And the stakes are high enough — we're talking about tens of thousands of pounds and a decision you'll live with for years — that getting it wrong really matters.</p>
<p>CamperDNA won't solve all of that. But it gives people a better starting point than a forum thread, a YouTube algorithm, or a dealer who wants to move a specific van.</p>
<p>That feels worth doing.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Where we are now</h2>
<p>This is an early version of what CamperDNA will eventually become. The tool works, the guides are growing, and the profile logic is built on real decisions made by real owners.</p>
<p>We're a small operation. There's no VC money, no growth targets — just a genuine interest in building something useful. The site stays free through product recommendations in our kit guides, clearly labelled, on things we'd recommend anyway.</p>
<p>If you've found it useful, the best thing you can do is share it with someone who's just starting their own research. That's how this grows.</p>
