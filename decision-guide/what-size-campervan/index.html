    <h2>Why size matters more than people expect</h2>
<p>The instinct when buying a campervan is to go bigger. More space equals more comfort, right? Up to a point. Beyond that point, a bigger van means harder parking, higher fuel costs, more restricted campsites, and — in a VW Transporter specifically — a layout that doesn't actually gain you as much as you'd think.</p>
<p>The right size is the one that matches how you'll actually use the van. Here's how to think about it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Wheelbase: SWB vs LWB</h2>
<p>VW Transporters come in two wheelbase options: short wheelbase (SWB) and long wheelbase (LWB). The practical difference in overall vehicle length is around 40cm.</p>
<h3>Short wheelbase</h3>
<p><strong>External length:</strong> approximately 4.9m</p>
<p><strong>Who it suits:</strong> couples or solo travellers, weekend users, people who want maximum manoeuvrability, urban dwellers who park on the street.</p>
<p><strong>The trade-off:</strong> a fixed bed that's long enough for a 6ft adult typically needs to run across the width of the van on a T6 SWB. This means sleeping across the van (which most people find comfortable) or a well-designed rock and roll bed or fold-flat arrangement. Storage under the bed is very usable.</p>
<p>A standard SWB T6 can comfortably accommodate two adults sleeping, a functional kitchen, a decent storage setup and a 12v electrical system without feeling cramped — if the conversion is well-designed.</p>
<h3>Long wheelbase</h3>
<p><strong>External length:</strong> approximately 5.3m</p>
<p><strong>Who it suits:</strong> families with children, taller adults who want a lengthwise fixed bed, people who prioritise interior living space over manoeuvrability.</p>
<p><strong>The trade-off:</strong> 40cm of extra length sounds modest but it changes what's possible inside significantly. A fixed bed can run lengthwise (head to toe) rather than across the van. There's more room for a larger kitchen, a separate seating area or a toilet. The LWB is closer to a proper small motorhome in its interior possibilities.</p>
<p>The downsides are real: harder to park in tight spaces, higher road and fuel costs, restricted from some campsites that have length limits, and — because the LWB is less common — a narrower used market.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Roof height: standard vs high-roof vs pop-top</h2>
<p>This is often the more consequential decision. The roof determines whether you can stand up inside the van, how you sleep, and what the van looks like.</p>
<h3>Standard roof</h3>
<p>You can't stand up. At around 1.25–1.3m of interior headroom, you're sitting or crouching. This feels less restrictive than it sounds when you're actually using the van — most van life happens sitting down — but it does limit what's possible in a kitchen and makes getting dressed and moving around more awkward.</p>
<p>Standard roof vans are lower-profile, better on fuel, fit in more car parks, and look less conspicuous (relevant for stealth camping).</p>
<h3>High-roof</h3>
<p>Around 1.9m of interior headroom. You can stand up fully. This changes the experience significantly — cooking is easier, changing is easier, the van feels more like a small living space than a very large car.</p>
<p>High-roof vehicles are taller and catch more wind on motorways, noticeably affecting fuel economy. They also don't fit in many multi-storey car parks.</p>
<h3>Pop-top roof</h3>
<p>The most popular option on a converted Transporter. The roof elevates (either front-hinged or rear-hinged) to create standing headroom inside. The upper section can be used for sleeping — either a full sleeping area for children or adults, or additional storage.</p>
<p>When down, the van retains a lower profile. When up, you have full standing room and often additional sleeping capacity. Most pop-tops use a canvas section that's weatherproof but not insulated — relevant for cold nights.</p>
<p>Pop-tops cost £2,500–£4,500 fitted, depending on type and supplier.</p>

<hr />
<h2>For families specifically</h2>
<p>If you're travelling with children, size decisions are different.</p>
<p>Two children under 10 can sleep in a pop-top roof space on most standard conversions. Two adults plus two children works well in an LWB with a pop-top — adults in the main sleeping area, children up top.</p>
<p>A family of four in an SWB without a pop-top is genuinely cramped and doesn't work well for overnight stays. Either the LWB or the pop-top (or both) are usually necessary.</p>
<p>Child safety seat points are a separate issue: rear seat belts are a legal requirement for any passenger-carrying configuration. Make sure any van you're assessing has these correctly fitted.</p>

<hr />
<h2>The practical rule</h2>
<p>Go as small as you can make work. A smaller van parks everywhere, drives more like a car, fits under barriers and campsite height restrictions, costs less to run and is less intimidating if you're new to driving something of this size. The additional space in a larger van has real benefits — but it also has real costs.</p>
<p>If you're genuinely unsure, hire both sizes for a weekend each before you buy. The difference in daily use is immediately apparent.</p>
