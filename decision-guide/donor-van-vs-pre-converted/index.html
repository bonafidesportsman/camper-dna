    <h2>The most important decision you'll make</h2>
<p>Before van type, layout or systems — this is the fork in the road. Donor vehicle and conversion, or buy pre-built? It's the question with the biggest implications for your budget, timeline and what you end up with.</p>
<p>Neither route is obviously better. They suit different people in different situations. Here's an honest comparison.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Buying pre-converted</h2>
<p>You buy a van that's already been converted. Someone else has made all the specification decisions, done the work, and you're buying the result.</p>
<h3>The case for it</h3>
<p><strong>You can use it immediately.</strong> No waiting months for a conversion slot, no living without the van while it's being built. You buy it, you drive it away.</p>
<p><strong>The spec is known.</strong> You can inspect the actual thing rather than making decisions based on drawings and conversations. You can sleep in it, cook in it, live in it for a weekend before you commit.</p>
<p><strong>No project management.</strong> Commissioning a conversion involves dozens of decisions, a relationship with a conversion company, and the possibility of things taking longer or costing more than planned. Buying pre-built sidesteps all of that.</p>
<p><strong>Financing is easier.</strong> Lenders are more comfortable with an existing asset than a conversion project.</p>
<h3>The case against it</h3>
<p><strong>You get someone else's spec.</strong> The layout, the systems, the materials — all chosen by someone else for their priorities, not yours. Fixed bed when you wanted rock and roll. Gas hob when you wanted induction. Pop-top when you wanted high-roof.</p>
<p><strong>Quality is opaque.</strong> You can inspect a conversion, but you can't fully know how well it was done. Insulation quality, electrical wiring standards, woodwork hidden behind panels — these things reveal themselves over time.</p>
<p><strong>The good ones sell fast.</strong> Well-specified pre-converted vans at fair prices move quickly. Finding the right van takes time and patience.</p>
<p><strong>Conversions are hard to change.</strong> A layout that doesn't quite work for you isn't a quick fix. Ripping out and redoing conversion work is expensive.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Donor vehicle and conversion</h2>
<p>You buy a base van and either commission a professional conversion, do it yourself, or some combination.</p>
<h3>The case for it</h3>
<p><strong>You get exactly what you want.</strong> Every decision is yours. Layout, bed position, kitchen, systems, materials, colours. The van is built around your actual requirements rather than someone else's.</p>
<p><strong>Quality is controllable.</strong> You choose the conversion company (or do the work yourself) and you specify the standard. A well-specified professional conversion outlasts most budget pre-built alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>The van is right.</strong> You choose the specific vehicle — the engine, the spec, the age, the mileage, the history — rather than buying whatever comes attached to the conversion.</p>
<p><strong>Self-build is possible.</strong> If you have the time, the skills and the patience, doing the conversion yourself significantly reduces the total cost.</p>
<h3>The case against it</h3>
<p><strong>It takes time.</strong> The typical lead time from reputable UK conversion companies is 3–9 months. Add the time to find and purchase the donor vehicle and you could be looking at a year before you're on the road.</p>
<p><strong>You're making decisions on drawings.</strong> Unlike buying pre-built, you're committing to a layout you haven't lived in. Get the decisions wrong and they're expensive to unpick.</p>
<p><strong>Project management is your job.</strong> Coordinating the donor vehicle purchase, the pop-top if you're having one, the conversion company and any additional specialists requires time and attention.</p>
<p><strong>Cost overruns are possible.</strong> Conversion projects can run over. Make sure you have a detailed quote and understand what's included and what isn't.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Who each route suits</h2>
<p><strong>Buy pre-converted if:</strong><br />
- You want to be in the van within a few weeks<br />
- You're flexible on specification and can find a van that's close to what you want<br />
- You want to see and test exactly what you're buying<br />
- You don't have the bandwidth to manage a build project</p>
<p><strong>Donor vehicle and conversion if:</strong><br />
- You have specific requirements that are unlikely to be met by the pre-built market<br />
- You have 6–12 months before you need the van<br />
- You're commissioning a high-specification conversion and quality matters more than speed<br />
- You're doing it yourself and have the skills and time</p>
<hr />
<h2>A practical note on the used pre-built market</h2>
<p>There's a middle route that gets overlooked: buying an older or lower-spec pre-built conversion and upgrading the systems over time. A solid T5 with a basic conversion at £18,000–£22,000 can be updated with a proper leisure battery, solar and heating setup for £1,500–£2,500 in parts. This route keeps costs manageable while letting you improve the van incrementally as you understand what you actually need.</p>
<p>It's not glamorous, but it's often the most rational starting point for people who aren't certain exactly what they want.</p>
