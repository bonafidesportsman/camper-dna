    <h2>Why the range is so wide</h2>
<p>Search "how much does a campervan cost" and you'll find answers ranging from £8,000 to £120,000. That's not because the question is unanswerable — it's because "campervan" covers an enormous range of vehicles, ages, specifications and build quality.</p>
<p>This guide breaks down the real cost by route and by category. The numbers reflect the UK market in 2025 and are based on current transactions rather than aspirational estimates.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Route 1 — Buying a pre-converted van</h2>
<h3>Entry level: £15,000–£28,000</h3>
<p>At this price point you're looking at older T5s (2010–2015 vintage), high-mileage T6s or non-VW bases. Conversions will be basic — rock and roll bed, a simple kitchen unit, basic 12v system. This is a workable starting point but expect to spend money on updating the electrics, improving insulation or fixing wear and tear in the conversion.</p>
<p>What you're getting for the lower end of this range is primarily the van itself. The conversion is a bonus rather than the point.</p>
<h3>Mid range: £28,000–£45,000</h3>
<p>This is the sweet spot for most buyers. T6s from 2016 onwards with professional conversions, reasonable mileage, and a specification that covers the essentials properly. A well-specified van in this range will have a proper leisure battery and solar system, decent insulation, a functional kitchen and a bed that doesn't require an engineering degree to convert.</p>
<p>Quality varies significantly at this price point. Use the inspection checklist and take someone who knows what to look for.</p>
<p><a href="/buying-a-van/inspection-checklist">Inspection checklist →</a></p>
<h3>High specification: £45,000–£75,000</h3>
<p>Professional conversion companies at the top of the market, low-mileage T6.1s, high-specification systems — LiFePO4 batteries, diesel heating, fixed beds, quality joinery. At this level the conversion cost alone is £25,000–£40,000.</p>
<p>This isn't a bracket where you're paying for luxury — you're paying for engineering quality, system reliability and a build that will last. Cheaper conversions cut corners on insulation, electrics and materials. Those corners cost money to fix later.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Route 2 — Donor vehicle plus conversion</h2>
<h3>Base vehicle: £10,000–£22,000</h3>
<p>A T6 in reasonable condition suitable as a donor vehicle — unwanted in its current configuration but sound mechanically. The lower end of this bracket buys a higher-mileage vehicle that's been well maintained; the upper end buys a low-mileage example in better condition. Budget at the higher end if you're commissioning a conversion — you'll be putting a lot of money into the van and you don't want mechanical surprises undermining it.</p>
<p><a href="/buying-a-van/buying-donor-vehicle">Donor vehicle buying guide →</a></p>
<h3>Professional conversion: £18,000–£40,000</h3>
<p>What a reputable UK conversion company charges. Significant variation exists depending on the company, the specification and current lead times. Get multiple quotes and check the spec sheets carefully — a cheaper quote often means a different spec, not the same spec for less money.</p>
<p>This covers labour, materials, systems and fit-out. It doesn't typically cover pop-top roof installations (those are usually subcontracted) or specialist modifications.</p>
<h3>Self-build conversion: £6,000–£15,000 in materials</h3>
<p>If you're doing the conversion yourself or with help, your materials cost depends almost entirely on the specification. A basic self-build with budget components is achievable for £4,000–£6,000. A well-specified self-build with quality materials — LiFePO4 battery, quality cabinetry, diesel heater — runs closer to £10,000–£15,000.</p>
<p>Your time has a cost too. A first-time self-build typically takes 500–800 hours. Factor that in honestly.</p>
<hr />
<h2>System costs (for budgeting)</h2>
<p>If you're assessing a van or planning a build, these are approximate 2025 component costs:</p>

<h2>Running costs</h2>
<p><strong>Insurance</strong> — Specialist campervan insurance through providers like Comfort, Adrian Flux or Brentacre runs £800–£1,500 per year for a standard risk profile. Standard vehicle insurance rarely covers a campervan adequately — check the policy wording carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Road tax</strong> — Motor caravan classification (if correctly applied for) attracts lower road tax. At standard vehicle rates, a 2.0 TDI Transporter pays in the higher brackets. Worth sorting the DVLA classification correctly.</p>
<p><a href="/buying-a-van/dvla-motor-caravan">DVLA motor caravan guide →</a></p>
<p><strong>Fuel</strong> — Budget 25–35mpg depending on spec, age and driving style. Motorway cruising on a loaded T6 is closer to 28–32mpg.</p>
<p><strong>Servicing</strong> — VW Transporter servicing through an independent VW specialist runs £250–£500 per service. Budget for a service every year or every 10,000 miles.</p>
<p><strong>Unexpected repairs</strong> — Budget £500–£1,000 per year as a contingency, more for older or higher-mileage vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Campsite fees</strong> — Highly variable. Wild camping costs nothing (and is legal in Scotland). Club sites run £25–£35 per night. Farm sites, CLs and smaller independents are often £15–£25. Factor this into your annual usage costs.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Total cost of ownership (indicative)</h2>
<p>For a mid-range pre-converted T6, used for 20 nights per year over five years:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>That cost-per-night figure looks alarming. Compare it to a hotel for two (£120–£200 per night) and it doesn't stack up. Compare it to the total cost of holidays that achieve something similar — the access, the flexibility, the outdoor lifestyle — and the calculation is less straightforward. But run the numbers honestly before you commit.</p>
