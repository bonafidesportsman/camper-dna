    <h2>The question nobody answers honestly</h2>
<p>Most campervan content is written by people who already own one and love it. That's understandable — if you've spent significant money on something and reorganised your life around it, you're invested in believing it was the right call.</p>
<p>But "is a campervan worth it" deserves a more honest answer than a YouTube video shot in golden hour on a Cornish clifftop. So here's our attempt.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The real cost of owning a campervan</h2>
<p>Before the lifestyle question, the money question.</p>
<p><strong>Purchase price</strong> — A decent pre-converted campervan in the current UK market starts around £25,000–£30,000 for something solid. A professionally converted T6 with a full specification runs £40,000–£65,000. A self-build route (donor vehicle plus parts plus labour) can come in at £20,000–£35,000 depending on spec.</p>
<p><strong>Running costs</strong> — VW Transporters are not economical. Expect 25–35mpg in real-world driving. Insurance for a campervan is a specialist market and typically runs £800–£1,500 per year for a standard driver profile. Road tax is modest. Servicing costs are broadly similar to any diesel van.</p>
<p><strong>Depreciation</strong> — Campervans have held their value unusually well over the past several years, particularly well-specified VW conversions. This isn't guaranteed to continue, but it's a better position than most vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong> — If you don't have a driveway or garage, storage costs money. Monthly secure storage for a van runs £80–£150 in most parts of the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity cost</strong> — The money tied up in a campervan isn't working elsewhere. This is a real cost that doesn't show up in most calculations.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What you actually get for that money</h2>
<p>A campervan gives you the ability to wake up somewhere beautiful without booking a hotel or pitching a tent in the rain. On a clear October morning on the North Yorkshire coast, or on a quiet lane in Pembrokeshire, that's genuinely hard to put a price on.</p>
<p>But let's be precise about what it actually unlocks:</p>
<p><strong>More spontaneity</strong> — no booking, no check-in time, no checkout time. You go when you want to go.</p>
<p><strong>Better access</strong> — you can park at trailheads, wake up at surf spots, sleep near things that are inaccessible by public transport.</p>
<p><strong>A different relationship with the UK</strong> — people who own campervans tend to spend more time outdoors and more time in parts of the country they'd never have visited otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility for families</strong> — a campervan that sleeps four people on a ten-day trip is significantly cheaper than a hotel for four for the same period.</p>
<hr />
<h2>When a campervan probably doesn't make sense</h2>
<p><strong>You'll use it fewer than eight to ten times a year</strong> — Below a certain usage level, hiring makes more financial sense. You can hire a well-specified campervan for £150–£250 per day. At ten days' use a year, that's £1,500–£2,500 — considerably less than the annual cost of owning one.</p>
<p><strong>You mainly want it for holidays</strong> — If you're thinking about two weeks in summer and a long weekend at Easter, the maths rarely works. Frequent users get the most value.</p>
<p><strong>You're expecting it to be low-maintenance</strong> — Older VW Transporters in particular can be expensive to keep running. Budget for unexpected costs.</p>
<p><strong>You're not sure you'll actually use it</strong> — This sounds obvious, but the campervan community is full of people who bought one in an optimistic moment and found their usage fell well short of what they'd imagined. If you haven't road-tested the lifestyle with a hire van, do that first.</p>
<hr />
<h2>When a campervan makes real sense</h2>
<p><strong>You camp or spend time outdoors regularly</strong> — If you're already doing weekends under canvas or in a roof tent, a campervan is an upgrade in comfort with a broadly similar price for frequent users.</p>
<p><strong>You have outdoor hobbies that drive travel</strong> — Surfing, hiking, trail running, cycling, climbing — activities that take you to specific places make a campervan a genuinely practical vehicle, not just a lifestyle choice.</p>
<p><strong>You have school-age children</strong> — A campervan changes family holidays significantly. The logistics simplify, the costs compare well to hotels over a season, and children tend to love the format.</p>
<p><strong>You work flexibly</strong> — Remote work and a campervan is a legitimate combination that changes what's possible in terms of where and how you spend time.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The test we'd suggest</h2>
<p>Before buying, hire a campervan for a long weekend — ideally in October or November, not summer. Sleep in it, cook in it, deal with the condensation on the windows and the limited worktop space and the shower situation. If you come back wanting more of that, you're probably a campervan person. If you come back relieved to be home, you've saved yourself a significant sum of money.</p>
<hr />
