    <p>The VW Transporter is the most popular base van for campervan conversions in the UK. Compact, reliable, and with a huge aftermarket of parts and accessories, it's an understandable choice. But if you're shopping in this market, you'll quickly face a question: T5 or T6? There's often a significant price difference between the two generations. Here's how to think about it.</p>
<h2>What's the actual difference?</h2>
<p>The T5 ran from 2003 to 2015. The T6 launched in 2015 (with a significant facelift to the T6.1 in 2019) and is still current as a base for conversions.</p>
<p>The headline differences:</p>
<p><strong>Exterior and interior:</strong> The T6 has a more modern nose, revised interior, better infotainment options, and in later variants, digital instruments and more driver assistance tech. None of this matters much for a conversion — the interior gets ripped out anyway — but it does affect the resale value and the kerb appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Engine:</strong> Both generations use variants of the TDI diesel engine. The T5 2.0 TDI units (particularly the 102bhp, 140bhp and 180bhp variants produced from 2009 onwards) are well-liked: reasonably frugal, proven reliability, and no AdBlue. The T6 moved to Euro 6 compliant engines which, in most variants, require AdBlue (diesel exhaust fluid) to meet emissions standards.</p>
<p><strong>AdBlue:</strong> This is the detail that catches many buyers out. T6 models with AdBlue have a separate tank that needs topping up every 5,000–10,000 miles or so. Running out of AdBlue means the van eventually won't start. The fluid itself is cheap, but the system adds a maintenance step and, on higher-mileage vans, occasional sensor or pump failures. Some buyers specifically seek out T5 models to avoid this entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Both generations are broadly reliable when properly maintained. The T6 hasn't had enough time to develop the long-term reputation the T5 has, but early indications are positive. Both suffer from the common VW DSG gearbox issues if specced with an automatic — manual is almost always the more reliable choice for a van that's going to be heavily used.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The price question</h2>
<p>In 2025/26 the price gap between a comparable T5 and T6 is typically £3,000–7,000 for private sales, sometimes more for low-mileage examples. A tidy, well-maintained T5 Transporter (2012–2015) with 100–150k miles sits at around £8,000–12,000 in the current market. An equivalent T6 (2016–2018) is £13,000–18,000. T6.1 models command a further premium.</p>
<p>Whether that gap is worth it depends on your situation. If you're building a conversion to sell, the T6 base commands a higher sale price and will be easier to shift. If you're building a keeper for personal use and budget is a genuine constraint, a well-chosen T5 is an excellent base that will serve you for years.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What to look for when buying</h2>
<p><strong>T5 (2009–2015):</strong><br />
- The 2.0 TDI 140bhp is the sweet spot — strong enough for a loaded van, good fuel economy<br />
- Avoid high-mileage DSG examples unless you're prepared for a gearbox service<br />
- Check for timing belt service history — it's a scheduled replacement item<br />
- Rust checks: sills, rear wheel arches, front arches and the step area under the rear doors are common trouble spots<br />
- Look for evidence of it being a panel van/commercial for most of its life — lower VAT purchase price but potentially heavier use</p>
<p><strong>T6 (2015–2019):</strong><br />
- Confirm whether it has AdBlue — not all T6s do (check the fuel filler area for a blue cap)<br />
- The 150bhp and 204bhp variants are more desirable; the 102bhp feels underpowered in a loaded conversion<br />
- T6s command a premium for any 4Motion (four-wheel-drive) variants — useful for off-road capability but adds complexity<br />
- Higher asking prices mean there are more traders dressing up average vans — pay for an independent inspection</p>
<hr />
<h2>Our honest take</h2>
<p>For most buyers building their first campervan on a budget, a good T5 is hard to fault. Find a 2012–2015 example with full service history, under 150k miles, manual gearbox and no structural rust, and you have a van that will take a solid conversion and serve you well for the next five to ten years.</p>
<p>If you want something more modern, are planning a professional-grade conversion to sell, or simply have the budget, the T6 is a nicer base and the premium is partly justified. The T6.1 is better again, but the price premium for a well-specced example is significant.</p>
<p>What both share is the fundamental appeal of the platform: the size is right, the parts availability is exceptional, the conversion community is huge, and there's a huge bank of knowledge available when something goes wrong.</p>
