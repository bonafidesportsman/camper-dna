    <h2>Start here</h2>
<p>If you've found this page, you're probably somewhere in the early stages: vaguely interested in campervans, not sure where to start, slightly overwhelmed by the volume of information out there. This guide is written for you.</p>
<p>We'll cover what a campervan actually is, the different types, the main decisions you'll face, and where to go next. No jargon, no assumption that you already know things.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What is a campervan?</h2>
<p>A campervan is a vehicle that's been adapted to allow sleeping and basic living inside it. Beyond that, the definition gets blurry.</p>
<p>At the minimal end: a panel van with a bed platform and a camping stove. At the maximal end: a fully fitted vehicle with a fixed bed, kitchen, shower, heating system, solar panels, and enough electrical capacity to run off-grid for several days.</p>
<p>Most of the campervans people are interested in in the UK sit somewhere in the middle — properly converted, properly specified, designed to be used year-round rather than just in summer.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The main types</h2>
<h3>Motorhomes</h3>
<p>Motorhomes are purpose-built living vehicles — long, tall, with full bathrooms, large kitchens and permanent sleeping arrangements. They're comfortable but large, expensive to run, and can feel like driving a house. A motorhome isn't really a campervan — it's a different category of vehicle.</p>
<h3>Panel van conversions</h3>
<p>Panel vans — VW Transporters, Ford Transits, Mercedes Sprinters, Peugeot Boxers — converted into campervans. This is what most people who say "campervan" are actually referring to. Compact enough to drive normally, versatile enough to actually live in. The conversion happens inside the van's standard body shell.</p>
<h3>Campervans (purpose-built)</h3>
<p>Volkswagen California, Westfalia and similar vehicles where the campervan conversion was done at the factory or by the original manufacturer. These tend to hold their value extremely well but are expensive new and limited in specification flexibility.</p>
<h3>Classic campervans</h3>
<p>VW Type 2s (T2, T3/Vanagon), older VW T4s and similar. Beloved, characterful and expensive to maintain. Not the practical choice for a primary vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>For most people starting out, a converted panel van is the right focus</strong> — specifically a VW T5 or T6 Transporter. That's what most of this site is about.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why everyone seems to choose a VW Transporter</h2>
<p>The VW T5 (2003–2015) and T6 (2015–2019) and T6.1 (2019–present) dominate the UK converted campervan market. There are good reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong, reliable engines with a long track record</li>
<li>Massive aftermarket support — parts are readily available, specialists everywhere</li>
<li>Large community of owners who share knowledge</li>
<li>Good resale value</li>
<li>The right size: big enough to live in, small enough to drive normally</li>
<li>A huge established market of used examples at all price points</li>
</ul>
<p>The main alternative is the Mercedes Sprinter or Ford Transit for people who want more space (at the cost of size), or the VW T4 for people on a tighter budget.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The decisions you'll face</h2>
<p>If you're heading towards buying a campervan, the main decisions are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Buy pre-converted or commission a conversion?</strong><br />
Buy something that's already been built, or start with a base vehicle and have it converted (or do it yourself). Both routes have real advantages. <a href="/decision-guide/donor-van-vs-pre-converted">Read the full guide →</a></p>
<p><strong>2. What spec do you actually need?</strong><br />
Fixed bed or rock and roll? Pop-top or high-roof? Solar or hookup-dependent? Off-grid capable or campsite-focused? These decisions depend on how you'll use the van. The CamperDNA tool helps you work this out. <a href="/your-camperdna">Get your profile →</a></p>
<p><strong>3. How much should you spend?</strong><br />
Realistic budgets range from £15,000 (older, basic) to £65,000+ (new, high-spec). Understanding what drives the price helps you spend wisely. <a href="/decision-guide/campervan-cost-uk">Full cost guide →</a></p>
<p><strong>4. T5 or T6?</strong><br />
The two main options in the VW Transporter market have different price points, different features and different reliability profiles. <a href="/decision-guide/vw-t5-vs-t6">T5 vs T6 guide →</a></p>
<hr />
<h2>Terms you'll encounter</h2>
<p><strong>Leisure battery</strong> — A separate battery, distinct from the vehicle's starter battery, that powers the habitation electrics (lights, fridge, water pump, charging). Almost every converted campervan has one.</p>
<p><strong>Split charge</strong> — A system that charges the leisure battery when the van's engine is running. Usually a relay or DC-DC charger.</p>
<p><strong>Solar</strong> — Solar panels on the roof that charge the leisure battery. Allows off-grid use without running the engine or connecting to mains.</p>
<p><strong>Night heater / diesel heater</strong> — A separate heater (most commonly Webasto or Eberspacher for premium, Chinese alternatives at lower cost) that burns a small amount of diesel to heat the van's living space. Essential for winter use.</p>
<p><strong>Rock and roll bed</strong> — A bench seat that folds flat to create a sleeping surface. Common in smaller vans where a fixed bed would take up too much floor space.</p>
<p><strong>Pop-top / elevating roof</strong> — A section of the roof that elevates to create standing room inside the van and often a sleeping area in the raised section.</p>
<p><strong>EHU (Electric Hook-Up)</strong> — A campsite mains electricity connection. Allows you to run 240v appliances and charge batteries without solar or running the engine.</p>
<p><strong>Wild camping</strong> — Camping outside of designated campsites, typically in a field, forest or by a road. Legal in Scotland, technically not in England and Wales but widely practised and generally tolerated when done respectfully.</p>
<p><strong>DVLA Motor Caravan classification</strong> — A legal classification for your vehicle that affects road tax, some insurance policies and certain travel regulations. Worth applying for if your van qualifies. <a href="/buying-a-van/dvla-motor-caravan">Full guide →</a></p>
<hr />
<h2>Where to start</h2>
<p>If you're new to this, the best first step is the CamperDNA tool. Answer the questions honestly — it takes about five minutes — and you'll get a personalised profile that tells you what type of van and what specification suits how you plan to use it. That profile gives you something concrete to take into your research rather than starting from a blank page.</p>
