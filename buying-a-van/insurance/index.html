    <h2>Why standard car insurance isn't enough</h2>
<p>A converted campervan is not a car. It's not a van. It's a vehicle with a habitation area, specialist systems and a value that includes the conversion as well as the base vehicle. Standard car or van insurance policies are not designed for this — and many won't pay out correctly if you make a claim on a vehicle they're not properly covering.</p>
<p>Specialist campervan insurance exists for this reason. It costs roughly similar to a good car policy, covers the things that matter, and is worth the small amount of additional research required to find the right policy.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What to look for in a campervan policy</h2>
<p><strong>Agreed value</strong> — The most important clause in any campervan policy. An agreed value policy insures your van for a specific, pre-agreed sum — say £38,000 — regardless of what the insurer's standard book value calculation would produce. Without this, the insurer may decide your converted van is worth considerably less than you paid for it. Insist on agreed value cover.</p>
<p><strong>Contents cover</strong> — Your camping kit, cooking equipment, bikes, surfboards and personal belongings inside the van need coverage. Check the limit — standard limits of £500 are often inadequate. Look for £2,000+ or a policy that allows you to increase the limit.</p>
<p><strong>European cover</strong> — If you're planning trips to Europe, check whether European cover is included or costs extra, and for how many days per year. 30–90 days of European cover is typical on a specialist policy.</p>
<p><strong>Habitation cover</strong> — Some policies specifically cover damage to the habitation area (the conversion fixtures and fittings) separately from the vehicle itself. This is worth having.</p>
<p><strong>Breakdown cover</strong> — Many specialist policies include or offer breakdown cover as an add-on. European breakdown cover is a separate question and is often better sourced separately.</p>
<p><strong>No claims discount</strong> — Check whether your existing car insurance no claims discount transfers. Most specialist insurers will accept it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Specialist insurers worth comparing</h2>
<p><em>Note: We use affiliate links in this section — these are labelled. The insurers listed are ones used and referenced by the campervan community; this isn't an exhaustive list and we're not recommending one over another without knowing your circumstances.</em></p>
<p><strong>Comfort Insurance</strong> — One of the most frequently referenced specialist campervan insurers in the VW community. Agreed value policies, specialist knowledge, responsive on claims. <span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Insurance "> Comfort Insurance Campervan Quote  ↗</span></p>
<p><strong>Adrian Flux</strong> — A major specialist broker covering campervans including self-builds and imports. Broad policy options. <span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Insurance "> Adrian Flux Campervan Quote  ↗</span></p>
<p><strong>Brentacre</strong> — Smaller specialist broker with a good reputation in the campervan community. Worth including in any comparison. <span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Insurance "> Brentacre Campervan Quote  ↗</span></p>
<p><strong>Saga</strong> — For over-50s. Often competitive on premiums for this demographic. <span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Insurance "> Saga Motorhome Insurance  ↗</span></p>
<p><strong>Compare the Market / GoCompare</strong> — Standard comparison sites don't always include specialist campervan insurers, but are worth checking for baseline comparison. <span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Insurance "> Compare the Market Motorhome Insurance  ↗</span></p>
<hr />
<h2>Self-build insurance</h2>
<p>A van you've converted yourself has specific insurance needs. Some insurers are cautious about self-builds; others are comfortable with them. The key questions they'll ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the electrical system installed by a qualified electrician?</li>
<li>Is there a gas system, and was it installed and certified by a registered Gas Safe engineer?</li>
<li>Is the conversion permanently fitted?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've done a self-build, be honest and specific when applying for insurance. Misrepresenting the conversion is a reason for a claim to be refused.</p>

<hr />
<h2>When to arrange insurance</h2>
<p>Before you drive the van away. Not after — before. If you're buying from a private seller, you need insurance in place before the keys change hands. Ring your preferred specialist insurer before the viewing, get a quote, and have the policy confirmed before collection day.</p>
<hr />
<h2>DVLA classification and insurance</h2>
<p>Your V5C should show "motor caravan" as the body type before you insure it as a campervan. If it still shows "panel van" or "goods vehicle," your specialist campervan policy may technically not be valid — or at minimum may complicate a claim. Sort the DVLA classification first.</p>
