  </div>

<div class="article-wrap">
  <div class="article-body">
    <h2>The problem with campervan research</h2>
<p>If you've spent any time on campervan forums, Facebook groups or YouTube, you'll know the feeling. You ask a simple question — what size van do I need, fixed bed or rock and roll, T5 or T6 — and you get twenty different answers, each one confident, half of them contradicting each other.</p>
<p>That's not because the community isn't helpful. It's because the right answer genuinely depends on <em>you</em> — how you'll use the van, who's coming with you, where you'll go, what you actually need versus what sounds appealing. A forum can't know that. CamperDNA can.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What CamperDNA does</h2>
<p>CamperDNA is a free profiling tool. You answer a set of questions about how you plan to use a campervan — trip length, travelling companions, where you'll stay, what seasons you'll use it — and it builds you a personalised spec: the van type, the layout, the systems, the priorities.</p>
<p>The output isn't a shopping list or a sales pitch. It's a clear picture of what a van built around your actual life looks like. You can use it to guide your own research, hand it to a conversion company as a brief, or simply get some clarity before you spend serious money.</p>
<p>It takes about five minutes.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Step 1 — Choose your starting persona</h2>
<p>Before the questions begin, you pick a starting persona. This isn't a commitment — it's a starting point that shapes which questions you're asked and how they're framed.</p>
<p>The five personas are:</p>
<p><strong>Family Adventurer</strong> — trips with kids and possibly a dog, school holidays and weekends, campsite-friendly</p>
<p><strong>Weekend Escaper</strong> — frequent short trips, couple or solo, year-round use, compact and practical</p>
<p><strong>Off-Grid Explorer</strong> — remote destinations, outdoor activities, no hookups, robust power and water systems</p>
<p><strong>European Road Tripper</strong> — extended tours, cross-border travel, comfort for long drives, compliance awareness</p>
<p><strong>Curious Beginner</strong> — not sure yet, just investigating, needs education before decisions</p>
<p>If you're genuinely not sure, start with Curious Beginner. The flow is designed to explain concepts as it goes, and it ends with a recommendation of which route suits you.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Step 2 — Answer the questions</h2>
<p>The questionnaire covers six core areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Usage frequency</strong> — how often you'll realistically use the van shapes everything from battery sizing to storage priorities</li>
<li><strong>Trip length</strong> — weekend trips and two-week European tours need very different water tanks, power systems and kitchen setups</li>
<li><strong>Who travels with you</strong> — sleeping layout, seating requirements and space planning all depend on this</li>
<li><strong>Where you'll stay</strong> — campsite-dependent or off-grid changes your entire electrical specification</li>
<li><strong>What seasons</strong> — year-round use in the UK has heating and insulation implications that summer-only use doesn't</li>
<li><strong>Where you'll travel</strong> — UK only or Europe affects insurance, breakdown cover and compliance requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions are presented one at a time. Each one has a tooltip explaining why it matters and what the implications of each answer are. You're never just clicking options blindly.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Step 3 — Get your profile</h2>
<p>At the end, CamperDNA generates your profile. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The van type and specification most suited to your use case</li>
<li>Recommended layout (fixed bed, rock and roll, pop-top or high-roof)</li>
<li>Power system sizing — battery capacity, solar, split charge</li>
<li>Heating recommendation and priority level</li>
<li>Water system guidance</li>
<li>The key trade-offs specific to your profile — where to spend, where to save</li>
</ul>
<p>The on-screen summary gives you the headline spec. Your full report — which goes into much more detail on each system, explains the reasoning behind each recommendation and flags the common mistakes for your profile — is delivered by email.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What CamperDNA isn't</h2>
<p>It isn't a van dealership. It isn't a conversion company. It isn't an affiliate machine dressed up as a tool.</p>
<p>The recommendations are based on the answers you give, not on what anyone is paying to be recommended. Where we do use affiliate links — clearly labelled in our guides — they help us cover the cost of running the site without charging you anything.</p>
