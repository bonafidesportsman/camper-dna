    <p>More arguments have been had at campsites about sleeping layouts than almost any other aspect of van conversion. Fixed bed or rock-and-roll? Lengthways or across? Single or double? The truth is there's no universally right answer — but there is a right answer for how you use your van. Here's how to think about it.</p>
<h2>The two main approaches</h2>
<h3>Rock-and-roll bed</h3>
<p>A rock-and-roll (or R&amp;R) bed is a rear bench seat that folds flat to become a bed. During the day it's seating — usually two-person bench facing forward, with seat belts — and at night it converts to a double sleeping surface with a fold of the backrest forward.</p>
<p>The big advantage is space efficiency. In a shorter wheelbase van, an R&amp;R bed is often the only way to have proper seating, a reasonable amount of standing space, and a double bed in the same footprint. Many SWB vans (VW T5/T6 SWB, Transit Custom, Vivaro) work brilliantly with this layout.</p>
<p>The downsides are worth knowing. The conversion takes a few minutes — it's simple, but you're making your bed every night and unmaking it every morning. The sleeping surface is typically lower to the floor than a raised fixed bed, which limits under-bed storage. And the mattress has to flex with the mechanism, so you're limited on mattress thickness unless you use a purpose-made R&amp;R mattress or a hybrid foam system.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> SWB vans, solo travellers or couples who want seating during the day, anyone prioritising floor space and build cost.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Fixed bed</h3>
<p>A fixed bed stays in bed configuration all the time. No conversion needed — you get in and sleep. The most common arrangement is either lengthways (running front to back) or transverse (running across the van, feet-to-wall).</p>
<p>Lengthways fixed beds are most common in LWB vans (VW T6 LWB, Transit, Sprinter) where there's enough length to sleep along the van without your feet hitting the bulkhead. This typically means the bed takes up the rear third or half of the van, with the kitchen/bathroom/living area forward of it. The main advantage is what you can store underneath: a full-length bed platform over the rear gives you a huge underfloor storage area — perfect for bikes, boards, or just keeping your kit out of the living space.</p>
<p>Transverse fixed beds run across the van. They're popular in conversions where the interior is shorter but wider — Sprinters and newer high-roof vans particularly. You sleep corner to corner, which can work for single sleepers or smaller couples, but can feel cramped for taller people or two adults of different heights.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> LWB vans, full-time users, couples who don't want to make the bed each night, any build where under-bed storage is important.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The overlap bed</h2>
<p>Some builders split the difference with a hybrid: a fixed single that extends into a double using a pull-out section or a fill-in piece. This is popular in family builds (kids sleep in the extension, adults sleep lengthways) and in vans where maximising daytime living space matters but a proper double at night is non-negotiable.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What most people get wrong</h2>
<p>The most common mistake is optimising for daytime photos rather than actual night-time use. A fixed bed looks great in a build diary. But if you're using the van for weekend festivals and you need seating for four, an R&amp;R setup serves you far better.</p>
<p>Second most common mistake: not thinking about what goes under the bed. The sleeping platform is wasted if you haven't designed the storage cavity that sits beneath it. Think about access points — lift-up boards, pull-out drawers, side doors — before the platform is built.</p>
<p>Third: not accounting for your height. A 6'2" person can't sleep diagonally in most SWB vans without their feet hitting the wall. Measure the internal length before you commit to a layout.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How roof height affects this</h2>
<p>Your roof choice interacts directly with your sleeping layout. A standard-roof van pushes you toward an R&amp;R bed (there's no comfortable sleeping platform above your head). A high-roof van opens up more options, including overhead sleeping bunks if you're building for a family. A pop-top often includes an overhead sleeping deck as part of the raise mechanism.</p>
