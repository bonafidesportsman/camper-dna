    <p>The electrical system is the one part of a van build that intimidates most people and is poorly understood by most converters who aren't specialists. Getting it wrong ranges from mildly annoying (lights that dim at night) to genuinely dangerous (fires from incorrectly fused wiring). Getting it right means unlimited hot water, proper lighting, device charging and a fridge that keeps running whether you're on hookup or deep in a forest.</p>
<p>Here's how a modern 12V campervan electrical system fits together.</p>
<h2>The building blocks</h2>
<h3>Leisure battery (the core)</h3>
<p>Your leisure battery is the heart of the system. Unlike your starter battery (which provides a short, high-current burst to start the engine), a leisure battery is designed to be discharged slowly and repeatedly over time — powering lights, a fridge, charging devices, running a pump — and then recharged.</p>
<p>The two main technologies are:</p>
<p><strong>AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat):</strong> The traditional choice. More affordable, widely available, tolerates poor charging better than lithium. The trade-off is that you should avoid discharging below 50% to preserve battery life, which means you're only using half the rated capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Lithium (LiFePO4):</strong> The modern choice for anyone serious about off-grid capability. Lithium batteries can be discharged to 20% (or lower) without damage, are significantly lighter, charge faster, and have a much longer cycle life. The upfront cost is higher, but the usable capacity per pound spent is increasingly competitive with AGM.</p>
<p>Most weekend builds start with 100–150Ah of AGM. Most full-time or off-grid builds go for 100–200Ah of lithium.</p>
<h3>Charging sources</h3>
<p>A leisure battery is only as good as your ability to keep it charged. There are three main ways to charge it:</p>
<p><strong>DC-DC charger (B2B charger):</strong> Charges your leisure battery from your vehicle's alternator while you drive. The DC-DC charger regulates the charging current to protect both the starter battery and the leisure battery — essential if you have lithium batteries, which require a different charge profile than the alternator delivers by default. Budget around £80–£200 for a reputable unit (Victron Orion-Tr Smart is the most commonly recommended).</p>
<p><strong>Solar panels:</strong> Roof-mounted panels that charge the battery when parked. One 100W panel is enough to top up a modest system on a sunny UK day. Two 200W panels will run a fridge, lighting and device charging indefinitely in summer. Solar is the most satisfying off-grid power source — silent, maintenance-free, and effectively free electricity once installed. <a href="/van-systems/solar-panels">See our solar guide →</a></p>
<p><strong>Shore power (hookup):</strong> A mains hook-up system lets you connect to a campsite electricity supply via a standard blue connector. A mains charger inside the van converts 230V AC to the correct charge profile for your leisure battery. Hookup also lets you run mains devices directly (kettle, hair dryer, laptop charger) without drawing on your battery at all.</p>
<h3>Inverter</h3>
<p>An inverter converts your 12V battery power into 230V AC — letting you run mains devices when you're not on hookup. Essential if you want to use a laptop, a small television, or charge equipment that doesn't have a 12V option.</p>
<p>Inverters come in two flavours: modified sine wave (cheaper, fine for most devices, but can cause problems with some sensitive electronics and motors) and pure sine wave (cleaner output, safe for all devices, recommended for anything containing a motor or precise electronics). A 1000W pure sine wave inverter is a solid starting point for most builds.</p>
<p>Be aware: an inverter draws significant current. Running a 2000W kettle off a 100Ah battery will flatten it quickly. Inverters are best for occasional use of higher-draw devices, not a replacement for a proper 12V kettle or a campsite hookup.</p>
<h3>Consumer unit and fusing</h3>
<p>Everything in your 12V system needs to be fused correctly — both at the battery and along each circuit. Undersized fuses blow unnecessarily; oversized fuses allow a fault to become a fire. A proper consumer unit (also called a distribution board or fuse box) routes power to individual circuits — lighting, fridge, USB sockets, water pump — each with its own correctly rated fuse or circuit breaker.</p>
<p>This is the part most DIY builds get wrong. It's not glamorous, but it's important.</p>
<hr />
<h2>A typical system wired together</h2>
<p>A well-designed campervan system looks like this: the leisure battery sits in a secure battery box, connected to the starter battery via a DC-DC charger. Solar panels on the roof connect to a solar charge controller (an MPPT unit like the Victron SmartSolar is the standard recommendation), which feeds the leisure battery. A shore power lead comes in through a dedicated socket, runs to a mains charger, and also to a small consumer unit for any 230V sockets. The 12V consumer unit distributes power to all the 12V loads. The battery monitor (a Victron BMV or SmartShunt is the most common choice) sits between the battery and the system, giving you accurate state-of-charge readings.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How big does your system need to be?</h2>
<p>Work backwards from your daily consumption. A 12V compressor fridge typically draws 30–50Ah per day. LED lighting, 5–10Ah. Phone and laptop charging, 10–20Ah. A diesel heater's control unit, 5–10Ah. A rough total of 60–80Ah per day is common for a couple using the van full-time.</p>
<p>With lithium, a 100Ah battery gives you roughly 80Ah of usable capacity — just about enough for one day with a margin. For true independence, 200Ah lithium + 200–400W solar is a sensible full-time system.</p>
