    <p>Your roof choice shapes almost everything else about how your van lives. It affects whether you can stand up, where you sleep, how the van handles on a motorway, whether it fits in a multi-storey car park, and how much you'll spend getting it ready to use. It's worth getting your head around the options before you commit.</p>
<p>There are three main routes: standard roof, high-roof (or SWB/LWB raise), and pop-top. Each involves real trade-offs. Here's what they actually mean in practice.</p>
<h2>Standard roof</h2>
<p>A standard-height Transit, Transporter or Sprinter is the van in its factory form — no modifications to the roof at all. You can still build a perfectly functional campervan in one, but you're working with the constraint that most adults cannot stand upright inside.</p>
<p>The advantages are real. Standard-roof vans are more aerodynamic, which means better fuel economy — particularly relevant if you're doing long motorway hauls across Europe. They fit in multi-storey car parks and most residential driveways without issue. And because there's no expensive roof modification, the overall build cost is lower.</p>
<p>The drawback is equally real: you'll be bending every time you move around inside. For weekend trips this is manageable. For extended travel, it wears on you. Most people who have lived in a van for longer than a fortnight wish they'd gone taller.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Weekend escapers, festival use, budget builds, vans that spend a lot of time in urban environments or tight parking.</p>
<hr />
<h2>High-roof (fixed raise)</h2>
<p>A high-roof conversion raises the entire roofline permanently. On a factory high-roof van (VW T5/T6 LWB, Ford Transit Custom, Mercedes Sprinter) this often means a standing height of 1.8–2.0m inside — enough for most people to stand upright and move naturally.</p>
<p>This is the most popular choice for full-time and extended van life, and for good reason. The extra height transforms the interior. You can cook standing up, get dressed without gymnastics, and generally inhabit the space rather than just survive in it. It also opens up significantly more storage options, particularly overhead.</p>
<p>The compromises are aerodynamic drag (fuel consumption goes up noticeably at motorway speeds), slightly reduced top-speed stability in crosswinds, and height restrictions — most standard multi-storey car parks have a 2.0–2.1m bar that a high-roof van will struggle with or be unable to clear.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Full-time use, families, anyone doing significant time in the van. If you can only afford one upgrade, this is usually it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Pop-top roof</h2>
<p>A pop-top is a section of roof that lifts — typically on a hinged mechanism or a scissor-lift system — when you're parked, then folds flat for driving. When raised, it provides standing headroom in the central section of the van. When closed, the van has a near-standard roof height.</p>
<p>The appeal is obvious: you get the standing space when you need it without the permanent height penalty. A closed pop-top van will often clear multi-storey car parks, fit in a standard residential garage, and drive with lower aerodynamic drag than a full high-roof.</p>
<p>But pop-tops come with their own complications. They add significant cost to a build — a properly fitted pop-top from a reputable converter typically costs £1,500–£3,500 depending on the van, the mechanism, and whether it includes a sleeping platform above. They introduce a potential leak point that needs regular maintenance and good-quality seals. And the sleeping space in the raised section — while genuinely useful — is not suitable for all adults (lower headroom, often narrower than the main sleeping area).</p>
<p>On VW Transporters in particular, the OEM pop-top or aftermarket California-style raise is a well-established and reliable option. On other vans, quality varies enormously by fabricator.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Owners who need low-profile practicality for day-to-day use and parking, but want the standing space at camp. Particularly popular on VW T5/T6 and smaller vans where a full high-roof conversion isn't available.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Which should you choose?</h2>
<p>Ask yourself honestly how you'll use the van. If it's weekends away and you're not particularly tall, a standard roof with a good layout is cheaper to build and easier to live with in a city. If you're spending weeks or months in the van, or if you cook and move around a lot inside, high-roof transforms the experience. If you want the best of both worlds and the budget allows, a pop-top is a legitimate solution — just make sure it's fitted properly.</p>
<p>One thing that surprises people: the roof decision feeds directly into your sleeping layout. A high-roof van gives you much more flexibility about where and how you sleep. A pop-top often means sleeping in the raised section (which can be cold and cramped in a bad winter). A standard-roof van pushes you toward a rock-and-roll bed or a fold-out arrangement at floor level.</p>
