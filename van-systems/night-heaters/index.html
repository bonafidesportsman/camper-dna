    <p>A decent heater is the difference between a van that's usable in October and one that's only comfortable in July. It's also the upgrade that most experienced van lifers say they wish they'd added earlier.</p>
<p>Here's how diesel night heaters work and which ones are worth the money.</p>
<h2>Why diesel, not gas?</h2>
<p>Most serious campervan builders choose diesel heaters over gas for a few reasons. Diesel is the same fuel your van runs on, so there's no separate gas supply to manage, no gas safety certificate requirement, and no weight or space taken up by bottles. Diesel heaters also thermostat brilliantly — they maintain a set temperature through a cold night without you doing anything.</p>
<p>Gas heaters (Truma, Whale) are simpler and cheaper to install, and perfectly fine for occasional use. But if the van is going to be used through autumn and winter, diesel is generally the better long-term choice.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How a diesel heater works</h2>
<p>A diesel night heater (sometimes called an air heater or parking heater) draws a small amount of diesel from your vehicle's fuel tank via a fuel pickup tube, mixes it with air, burns it in a sealed combustion chamber, and blows warm air through a heat exchanger into the van's interior. The combustion gases are exhausted outside. The whole process draws very little electricity — typically 10–25W while running at full output — making it compatible with even modest battery systems.</p>
<p>Most heaters have a thermostat. You set a temperature, the heater runs to reach it, then modulates to maintain it. On a cold night it might run for 30–45 minutes to warm the van and then cycle on and off for the rest of the night.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Webasto and Eberspächer</h2>
<p>These are the OEM-grade German brands. Both make heaters that are installed as standard on commercial vehicles, motorhomes, and marine applications worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Webasto Air Top:</strong> The benchmark for reliability. The Air Top range (2000ST, 2000STC) is well-regarded for its durability, quiet operation, and the quality of its installation components. Fuel consumption is low, altitude performance is good, and parts are widely available. The downside is cost — genuine Webasto units start at £600–900 and are often closer to £1,000+ when supplied with the full installation kit.</p>
<p><strong>Eberspächer Airtronic:</strong> Comparable in quality and reputation. The D2 (2kW) is a common choice for smaller van builds. Eberspächer's after-sales network is strong, particularly in the UK. Similarly priced to Webasto.</p>
<p>For a van that's going to be used seriously through winter, or a professional conversion that needs to last 10+ years, these are the right choice.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Autoterm (formerly Planar)</h2>
<p>A respected mid-tier brand. Autoterm heaters are manufactured in Estonia and have an established reputation in the van-life and overlanding communities. Quality and reliability are considerably better than the Chinese budget options (see below), with prices in the £300–500 range depending on output. A good compromise if the Webasto/Eberspächer price is a stretch.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Chinese alternatives (Vevor, Hcalory and friends)</h2>
<p>The market is flooded with diesel heaters sold under various brand names — Vevor, Hcalory, Redneck, Seaflo — that are almost all built in the same Chinese factories to similar specifications. They're sold at £80–150 and are, in many cases, functional.</p>
<p>The honest assessment: many people run these units without problems. They heat a van. The basic concept is sound. But quality control is inconsistent — some units run perfectly for years, others fail within a season. The after-sales support ranges from minimal to non-existent. The installation hardware (particularly the fuel fittings and exhaust components) is often lower quality than the branded equivalents.</p>
<p>If budget is genuinely the constraint and you're willing to be your own support service, a budget unit can work. But for a van that needs reliable heating through a UK winter, the extra investment in an Autoterm or used Webasto/Eberspächer is worth it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Installation basics</h2>
<p>A diesel heater installation involves: mounting the unit (usually under a seat or in a storage area), running a fuel pickup tube into the tank (most vans have a secondary bung on the fuel tank for exactly this purpose), routing the exhaust outside (typically through the floor or a rear panel), ducting the warm air output into the living space, and wiring the control unit to the leisure battery.</p>
<p>A professional install typically costs £200–400 in labour. A confident DIYer can do it in a day with care. The critical points are the fuel line routing (fire risk if done incorrectly) and the exhaust routing (CO risk if not properly sealed to the outside).</p>
<hr />
<h2>Output sizing</h2>
<p>Most van builds run on a 2kW unit and never need more. A 2kW heater will warm an insulated medium-size van from cold on a winter night without working hard. Larger Sprinters or particularly cold climates might warrant a 4kW unit, but it's rarely necessary. Better insulation does more to reduce heating demand than a larger heater.</p>
