    <h2>You're the Off-Grid Explorer</h2>
<p>Somewhere on the map without a campsite. No hookup. No neighbours. Just the van, whatever you've brought with you, and however many days you've got. This is the profile that makes a campervan genuinely different from a holiday cottage — the ability to stop where you want and stay as long as you like.</p>
<p>The Off-Grid Explorer profile is also the most technically demanding to get right. The gap between a van that makes you feel free and one that makes you feel anxious about running out of power at 9pm is entirely in the spec — and it's a gap a lot of builds fall into.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What defines this profile</h2>
<p>Off-Grid Explorers want to stay away from campsites as much as possible. Remote or semi-remote destinations are the point: mountain passes, forest tracks, coastal spots that close to traffic at dusk. Activities tend to be outdoor and physical — hiking, mountain biking, surfing, climbing.</p>
<p>Trips vary: some are long weekends, some are week-long expeditions. The van needs to sustain itself without external power, water, or waste connections for several days at a time. This profile often involves solo or couple travel, year-round use, and a strong preference for going where other people haven't.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What this means for your spec</h2>
<p><strong>Your power system is the heart of the build.</strong> Everything else is secondary. For genuine multi-day off-grid use, you need a lithium battery bank of at least 150–200Ah, a solar array of 250W or more, and a battery-to-battery charger so driving tops up the system on overcast days. This is not where to cut costs. An undersized power system defines the ceiling on everything else — your lighting, your heating, your fridge, your devices.</p>
<p><strong>A night heater is not optional.</strong> If you're going to remote locations in shoulder season or beyond, temperatures drop fast once the sun goes. A diesel night heater runs efficiently off the fuel tank, puts out serious heat, and uses minimal power. It's the single item that extends your usable season more than anything else in the build.</p>
<p><strong>Water independence matters.</strong> A standard 20–30L tank runs out quickly when you're not on a campsite tap. Off-Grid Explorer builds typically need 60–100L of onboard water — and a waste tank to match. Some builds add a simple gravity-fed outdoor shower, which is a quality-of-life upgrade that costs relatively little once the water system is properly sized.</p>
<p><strong>The high roof changes the experience.</strong> If you're spending days at a time inside the van — waiting out weather, working, cooking — standing height is not a luxury. It's what stops the van feeling like a tent. An SWB high-roof conversion can give you genuine off-grid independence without needing a long-wheelbase vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Storage for kit needs planning.</strong> Surfboards, bikes, climbing gear, water sports equipment — whatever your activity, it needs to live somewhere. A garage space (under-bed storage accessible from the rear) or a roof rack system needs to be in the design from day one, not added as an afterthought.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The trade-offs to understand upfront</h2>
<p><strong>A proper off-grid build costs more.</strong> A lithium battery bank, large solar array, big water system, and night heater are not cheap. Trying to do this on a tight budget leads to compromises that undo the whole point. Be honest about your numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Weight is a real constraint.</strong> A fully-specced off-grid van with water, batteries, and gear is heavy. This affects payload, handling, and for some vehicles, the type of licence required. Know your base vehicle's payload figure before speccing the build.</p>
<p><strong>Off-grid doesn't mean wild camping everywhere is legal.</strong> In England and Wales there is no general right to wild camp. Scotland has different rules. Europe varies by country. The van gives you the capability — the research gives you where to actually use it.</p>

<p>Five minutes in the questionnaire tells us about your destinations, your activities, how long you stay away, and what you're working with in terms of budget. You get back a specific off-grid spec — not aspirational, practical — based on how you actually travel.</p>
