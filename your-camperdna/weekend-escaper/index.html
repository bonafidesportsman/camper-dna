    <h2>You're the Weekend Escaper</h2>
<p>Friday afternoon, van packed, somewhere new by dark. Back Sunday evening. Do it again in three weeks. This is the van that gets used, not the van that sits on the drive waiting for the summer holidays.</p>
<p>The Weekend Escaper is the profile that most often leads to a genuinely great van — because the brief is tight and the usage is consistent. But it's also the profile where people are most tempted to over-engineer, spending money on systems they'll rarely use and missing the things that make short trips effortless.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What defines this profile</h2>
<p>Weekend Escapers use their van frequently — often every few weeks — for short trips of one to four nights. Usually a couple, sometimes solo. Year-round use is common, which changes the spec more than people expect.</p>
<p>The destination varies: a long-walk weekend in the hills, a surf trip, a music festival, somewhere new on the map. The van isn't a luxury touring vehicle — it's a practical, dependable escape hatch that starts easily on a November Friday evening and doesn't let you down.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What this means for your spec</h2>
<p><strong>Smaller is better.</strong> A short-wheelbase van is easier to park, faster to load, easier to drive every day if you use it as your main vehicle, and significantly cheaper to build out. The Weekend Escaper rarely needs the extra floor space of a long-wheelbase — you're not inside the van for three days straight, you're using it as a base while you're out doing something.</p>
<p><strong>The Rock &amp; Roll bed is your friend.</strong> It converts in seconds and disappears when you don't need it. For short trips where you're in and out of the van constantly, a permanent fixed bed is often more compromise than it's worth unless you specifically value the ease of it.</p>
<p><strong>Year-round use means you need a heater.</strong> This is the single most important spec decision for a Weekend Escaper and the one most often skipped. A diesel night heater makes a January trip in the Yorkshire Dales genuinely comfortable. Without one, cold-weather use is miserable enough that you stop going — which defeats the whole point.</p>
<p><strong>Keep the power system simple.</strong> Two nights on a campsite or occasional wild camp doesn't need a £2,000 lithium battery system. An 80–100Ah AGM battery with a 100W panel handles lights, USB charging, and running a night heater without drama. Upgrade later if your usage changes.</p>
<p><strong>Don't over-kitchen it.</strong> A Weekend Escaper rarely needs a full compressor fridge and a two-ring hob. A cool box or small 12V fridge, a single burner, and a decent setup for making coffee in the morning covers 90% of what you'll actually do.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The mistakes Weekend Escapers make</h2>
<p><strong>Buying a long-wheelbase van "just in case."</strong> The extra space rarely gets used on short trips. The harder parking and higher cost get experienced every time.</p>
<p><strong>Delaying the build until everything is perfect.</strong> The best Weekend Escaper van is the one you're actually using. A simple, functional fit-out that gets finished is worth far more than an elaborate one that's still in progress six months later.</p>
<p><strong>Spending big on off-grid capability for occasional wild camping.</strong> A hybrid setup — campsite hookup plus a modest solar panel — is the sensible starting point. Full off-grid is a significant cost and weight addition that only makes sense if wild camping is genuinely regular.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Ready to build your profile?</h2>
<p>The questionnaire takes about five minutes. It asks about your trip frequency, who travels with you, the seasons you use the van, and what you do when you get there. You come out with a specific, honest van spec — not a wish list, a starting point that actually matches how you travel.</p>
