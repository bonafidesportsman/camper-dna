    <h2>You're the Curious Beginner</h2>
<p>You're not sure yet. Maybe you've seen someone else's van and thought: I want that. Maybe you've just done a camping trip that felt like too much faff and someone suggested a campervan instead. Maybe you've been quietly watching YouTube videos for three months and you're starting to think this might actually be something you do.</p>
<p>You haven't committed. You're not ready to put money down. But you want to understand the world well enough to know if it's actually for you — and if it is, what the right move looks like.</p>
<p>This is the right place to start.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What makes this profile different</h2>
<p>The other four CamperDNA profiles — Family Adventurer, Weekend Escaper, Off-Grid Explorer, European Road Tripper — all have a reasonably clear picture of how they want to use a van. The Curious Beginner doesn't, and that's completely fine. Not knowing yet is not a problem to fix before you start. It's the honest starting point.</p>
<p>What the Curious Beginner needs isn't a spec. It's a framework for making decisions — a way to understand what questions to ask, what the key trade-offs are, and how to move from 'I think I want a campervan' to 'I know what kind of van I need and why.'</p>
<p>That's what CamperDNA is designed to do.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The first question that actually matters</h2>
<p>Most people start by asking: which van should I buy? It's the wrong first question.</p>
<p>The right first question is: how do I want to use it?</p>
<p>Everything else follows from that. A couple who wants to go surfing on long weekends needs a completely different van from a family who wants school holiday touring. Both are different again from someone who wants to work remotely and travel slowly across Europe for six months. The base vehicle, the layout, the systems, the budget — all of it is determined by usage, not by brand preference or what looks good in photos.</p>
<p>Until you've got a clear picture of how you'll use the van, any spec you build is a guess.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The two decisions you'll need to make</h2>
<p>Before anything else, there are two fundamental choices that shape everything downstream.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-converted or donor + conversion?</strong> A pre-converted van is one someone has already fitted out. You buy it and use it. A donor van is a bare panel van — or a van you already own — that you either self-convert or send to a professional converter. Pre-converted is faster, simpler, and usually more expensive for a given spec. Converting gives you control over every decision but takes longer, costs more in time, and requires either skills or a budget for a converter.</p>
<p>Neither is better in the abstract. The right answer depends on your budget, your timeline, whether you enjoy building things, and how specific your requirements are. The <a href="/decision-guide/donor-vs-pre-converted">Donor vs Pre-Converted guide</a> walks through this properly.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of trips are you actually imagining?</strong> Not aspirational trips — the ones you'll actually take in the first year. Weekend escapes? Family holidays? Something longer? Being honest here matters, because the spec that fits your real-life usage is usually simpler and cheaper than the one that fits your best-case scenario.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What happens in the questionnaire</h2>
<p>Because the Curious Beginner hasn't fixed their usage pattern yet, the questionnaire takes a slightly different path. It starts with what appeals to you about van life, asks about your rough timeline, and uses those answers to guide you toward the questions that are actually relevant.</p>
<p>By the end, you'll have a starting point: a first-pass profile that reflects what you've said and points you toward the decisions worth making next. It's not a finished spec — it's an honest foundation.</p>
<hr />
<h2>A word on not overthinking it</h2>
<p>The campervan world rewards people who start simply and build up. A modest van that gets used every month is worth infinitely more than an elaborate one that takes three years to build and sells before it's finished.</p>
<p>If you're at the beginning, the goal isn't to arrive at a perfect spec. It's to understand enough to take a sensible first step — and to avoid the obvious mistakes that cost people money and time before they've even had a trip.</p>
