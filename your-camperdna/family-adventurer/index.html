    <h2>You're the Family Adventurer</h2>
<p>School holidays booked solid. A dog that goes everywhere. A boot full of wellies, spare clothes, and something that was a snack three hours ago. If this sounds like your life, you're in the right place.</p>
<p>The Family Adventurer is the most common campervan profile we see — and also the one where people most often get the spec wrong. Not because the brief is complicated, but because it's easy to underestimate how much space a family actually needs once you're living in a van for five days.</p>
<p>This page explains what the Family Adventurer profile means for your van build or buying search, and why certain decisions matter more than others.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What defines this profile</h2>
<p>Family Adventurers tend to use their van for school holiday trips and occasional long weekends throughout the year. Trips run from two nights to two weeks. The van needs to work for at least two adults and one or more children — and often a dog on top of that.</p>
<p>You're mostly staying on campsites with electric hookup, which keeps the power system simpler. But you're also doing shoulder-season trips — Easter, October half-term — so heating isn't optional.</p>
<p>The van is a family vehicle first and a campervan second. That means it needs to feel liveable, not compromised.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What this means for your spec</h2>
<p><strong>Space is non-negotiable.</strong> A short-wheelbase van works for a couple. Add two children and a Labrador and you need a long-wheelbase base vehicle — full stop. This single decision affects everything else: sleeping layout, storage, kitchen space. Get the wheelbase right first.</p>
<p><strong>Sleeping layout drives the floor plan.</strong> Most Family Adventurer builds use a Rock &amp; Roll bed rather than a fixed bed. It converts quickly, frees up floor space during the day for kids, and means you're not stepping over a permanent bed every time you move around the van. A fixed rear bed works too, but only if the wheelbase is long enough to keep usable living space in front of it.</p>
<p><strong>Heating is essential, not optional.</strong> If you're using the van in October or at Easter you need a diesel night heater. A van that's cold at 2am with young children in it is a miserable experience. This is one of the items most often left out of first builds to save money, and it's almost always added later at greater cost.</p>
<p><strong>Electric hookup first, solar backup.</strong> If you're primarily on campsites, a large solar setup isn't a priority. A 100W panel and a decent leisure battery is enough for lights, USB charging, and running the heater. Save the budget for the things that affect daily comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Belted rear seating.</strong> If your children are travelling in the van, they need to be in proper seats with seatbelts — this is a legal requirement. Not all conversions include this. If you're buying pre-converted, check this explicitly. If you're self-building or commissioning a conversion, specify it from the start.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The mistakes Family Adventurers make</h2>
<p><strong>Buying a short-wheelbase van and regretting it.</strong> It always feels big enough in the forecourt. It never feels big enough on night three with two tired children and a wet dog.</p>
<p><strong>Skipping the heater.</strong> It will get cold. You will wish you had one.</p>
<p><strong>Prioritising the kitchen over the layout.</strong> A beautiful kitchen in a van with no usable living space is a bad trade. Get the floor plan right first; the kitchen can always be upgraded later.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Ready to build your profile?</h2>
<p>The questionnaire takes about five minutes and asks the questions that actually matter for your specific situation — trip length, who travels, where you go, what you do when you get there. At the end you get a personalised spec: not a generic family van, your family van.</p>
