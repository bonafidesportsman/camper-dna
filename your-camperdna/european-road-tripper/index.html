    <h2>You're the European Road Tripper</h2>
<p>Three weeks. France down to the Pyrenees, maybe into Spain. Or the Atlantic coast from Brittany to Portugal. Or the Alps in summer, the Dolomites in autumn. The van doesn't come home until you're ready.</p>
<p>The European Road Tripper profile is about one thing more than anything else: comfort over distance. Not luxury for its own sake, but the kind of setup that makes living and driving out of a van for weeks at a time feel sustainable rather than endurance.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What defines this profile</h2>
<p>European Road Trippers take extended trips — typically two weeks to several months — across multiple countries. They spend more nights in the van than most other profiles, which means the quality of the sleeping setup, the kitchen, and the living space matters more than on short trips.</p>
<p>Travel is a mix of campsites and wild camping. The van drives motorways and mountain passes. It parks in cities and in remote locations. It needs to be compliant, capable, and comfortable — all three.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What this means for your spec</h2>
<p><strong>A long-wheelbase base vehicle is almost always right.</strong> When you're living in the van rather than visiting it, the extra floor space of an LWB pays dividends every single day. The difference between a standing kitchen and a crouching one matters at breakfast on day fourteen. A fixed bed that's always made means one less task every evening after a long drive.</p>
<p><strong>The fixed bed changes how you live.</strong> For short trips, the Rock &amp; Roll bed is a practical trade-off. For extended touring, having a bed that's always ready — that you step into rather than assemble — is a genuine quality-of-life upgrade. It's the conversion detail that European Road Trippers who've done a trip without one consistently say they wish they'd had.</p>
<p><strong>Heating needs to work across climates.</strong> Southern France in September is warm. The Alps in October is not. The Atlantic coast in November is cold and wet. A diesel night heater is essential — not because you'll use it every night, but because the nights you need it, you really need it.</p>
<p><strong>The fridge is a non-negotiable.</strong> A 12V compressor fridge is one of the most impactful comfort upgrades in a touring van. It keeps food properly cold across multiple days without ice, works efficiently on solar or hookup, and means you're not shopping every day or eating disappointing meals. This is not a luxury for extended touring — it's a system.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance is a real checklist, not a formality.</strong> Taking a campervan to Europe requires more preparation than people expect. Your insurance policy needs to cover European use — and specifically the countries you're entering. You may need to notify the DVLA if you're going to be abroad for extended periods. European breakdown cover from a provider with genuine recovery capability (not just roadside assistance) is essential. A UK sticker is now required post-Brexit. Beam deflectors for driving on the right. Some countries have specific requirements for gas systems. The full report covers this in detail.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The trade-offs to understand upfront</h2>
<p><strong>The spec costs more.</strong> An LWB base vehicle, fixed bed, compressor fridge, proper heating, and a reasonable solar setup for mixed campsite and wild use is a more expensive build than a minimal short-trip van. The costs scale with the ambition of the touring.</p>
<p><strong>Size has trade-offs in cities.</strong> An LWB Sprinter or Transit is not easy to park in Lyon or Lisbon. Some European Road Trippers choose a slightly smaller base vehicle — a VW T6 LWB rather than a full panel van — specifically to retain urban mobility. Worth thinking about before committing to the largest possible van.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation time is real.</strong> The compliance checklist, the insurance review, the breakdown cover — these take time to sort properly. Build in lead time before a first major trip, especially for the paperwork.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Ready to build your profile?</h2>
<p>The questionnaire asks about your trip length, where you travel, how you use the van when you get there, and what your budget looks like. You come out with a spec that's honest about what European touring actually requires — and where you can sensibly trade off.</p>
