    <h2>Independent. Free. Built by an owner, not a seller.</h2>
<p>CamperDNA exists because buying into the campervan world is genuinely complicated — and most of the advice you find online has something to sell you.</p>
<p>Not here. This site was built by someone who went through the whole process: the forum rabbit holes, the contradictory advice, the van viewings, the conversion decisions, the mistakes that only become obvious after you've lived with them for a season. CamperDNA is the resource that should have existed at the start of that process.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why we built it</h2>
<p>The campervan community is one of the warmest, most generous communities you'll find. People share knowledge freely, help each other out, and genuinely love what they do. That's not the problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that the information landscape is noisy and commercially compromised. YouTube channels recommend vans and products they're paid to feature. Review sites rank conversion companies who've paid for placement. Forums give you the collective wisdom of hundreds of people — none of whom know anything about your specific situation.</p>
<p>The result is that most people buying their first campervan either spend too much on things they don't need, or spend too little on things that matter, or end up with a van that doesn't actually fit the life they were planning to live in it.</p>
<p>CamperDNA tries to fix that. Not by telling you what to think — but by starting with the right questions.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How we make money</h2>
<p>We use affiliate links in our guides. When you click a link and buy something, we earn a small commission at no cost to you. Affiliate links are always clearly labelled.</p>
<p>That's it. We don't accept payment for editorial coverage, we don't run sponsored posts, and we don't recommend things we wouldn't use ourselves.</p>
<p><a href="/how-we-make-money">Read our full transparency statement →</a></p>
<hr />
<h2>What we know and what we don't</h2>
<p>We understand VW Transporters well. We've built a conversion, we've lived with it in all seasons, and we've made plenty of the mistakes this site tries to help you avoid.</p>
<p>We don't know everything. Where our knowledge runs out, we say so. We'll point you towards people who know more than we do rather than bluff through something outside our expertise.</p>
<p>That's the deal.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Get in touch</h2>
<p>Questions, corrections, suggestions — we read everything sent to us. We can't reply to every message but we do read them, and good feedback has made this site better.</p>

<h2>Start here</h2>
<p>If you're new to all this, the CamperDNA tool is the best place to begin. Five minutes of questions, a personalised spec at the end. Free.</p>
