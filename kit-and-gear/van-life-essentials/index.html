  <div class="article-body">
    <p class="affiliate-notice">This page contains affiliate link placeholders. Links will be added once CamperDNA's Amazon Associates account is live.</p>
    <p><em>This post contains affiliate links — marked with [affiliate link]. If you buy through one, we earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. <a href="/how-we-make-money">How that works →</a></em></p>
<hr />
<h2>The kit that earns its place every time</h2>
<p>Van life content tends to show you the aspirational version: the coffee at the cliff edge, the golden hour behind the open doors, the neatly organised interior. That stuff is real. But it's not what makes the trips actually work.</p>
<p>What makes trips work is the kit that goes in the van without question, every single time, because you've learned — usually the hard way — what happens when it's not there. This is that list.</p>
<p>It isn't glamorous. Some of it is genuinely boring. All of it has been tested over multiple seasons and different conditions, and none of it is here because anyone paid us to include it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. A proper CO detector</h2>
<p>This isn't optional. A diesel night heater, a gas hob, cooking in a confined space — carbon monoxide is a real risk in a van, and it's odourless. You won't know it's happening until it's too late.</p>
<p>Buy a proper one, not the cheapest detector you can find. Check it before every trip.</p>
<p><span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Amazon "> Kidde Carbon Monoxide Alarm  ↗</span></p>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong> battery-powered (not mains-dependent), British Standard BS EN 50291 certified, with a digital display showing current CO levels rather than just an alarm.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. A decent head torch</h2>
<p>Not a phone torch. An actual head torch with multiple brightness modes and a red night-vision mode. You'll use this for everything: finding stuff in the van at 3am, cooking when the interior light isn't enough, navigating to a wild camp toilet spot in the dark.</p>
<p><span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Amazon "> Petzl Actik Core Head Torch  ↗</span></p>
<p>The Petzl Actik Core is rechargeable via USB, runs for hours, and is bright enough for real use. Generic cheap head torches are fine for emergencies but annoying in daily use.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. A microfibre cloth and window vac</h2>
<p>Condensation is the uninvited third passenger on every campervan trip. Even with good insulation and ventilation, you'll have moisture on the windows in the morning. A window vac deals with this in about two minutes; without one it takes a towel you'll need for other things.</p>
<p><span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Amazon "> Karcher WV2 Window Vac  ↗</span></p>
<p>The Karcher WV2 is compact, cheap to run and does the job. Worth every penny for the morning routine.</p>
<hr />
<h2>4. A small fire extinguisher</h2>
<p>Cooking in a small space, a diesel heater, electrical systems — the risk isn't high but the consequences of not having one are catastrophic. A 1kg dry powder extinguisher fits easily under a seat and covers most plausible scenarios.</p>
<p><span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Amazon "> 1kg ABC Dry Powder Fire Extinguisher  ↗</span></p>
<p>Check the pressure gauge before each season. Replace if discharged even partially.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5. A collapsible washing-up bowl</h2>
<p>Sounds mundane. Is genuinely transformative. A collapsible silicone bowl gives you a sink when you're wild camping, a washing-up station when the campsite sink is a five-minute walk away, and doubles as a dog water bowl, a foot wash and a general-purpose container.</p>
<p><span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Amazon "> Collapsible Silicone Washing Up Bowl  ↗</span></p>
<p>Get one large enough to actually wash a pan in. The small ones are useless.</p>
<hr />
<h2>6. A good travel towel</h2>
<p>A standard bath towel takes forever to dry in a van and takes up significant storage space. A quality travel towel (Sea to Summit or similar) dries in 30–40 minutes on a door hook, compresses to almost nothing and doesn't smell after a few uses.</p>
<p><span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Amazon "> Sea to Summit Tek Towel Medium  ↗</span></p>
<p>Buy two. One is always slightly damp when you need a dry one.</p>
<hr />
<h2>7. Biodegradable soap and washing-up liquid</h2>
<p>If you're wild camping — or staying anywhere without mains drainage — using standard washing-up liquid or soap is doing real damage to the water sources you're camping near. Biodegradable versions work identically in use and matter enormously if you're washing up near a stream or emptying grey water onto grass.</p>
<p><span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Amazon "> Dr Bronner's Pure Castile Liquid Soap  ↗</span></p>
<p>Dr Bronner's is the standard recommendation in the outdoor community — works as soap, shampoo and washing-up liquid.</p>
<hr />
<h2>8. A proper doormat</h2>
<p>Mud, wet grass, sand, grit — all of these make their way into the van on boots and shoes and destroy flooring and sleeping areas very quickly. A proper outdoor doormat that you shake out and leave at the doors is the simplest and most effective way of keeping the interior clean.</p>
<p><span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Amazon "> Van Life Door Mat Outdoor  ↗</span></p>
<p>Get one that clips or hooks to the door so it doesn't blow away. A large boot tray inside the van doubles up in wet conditions.</p>
<hr />
<h2>9. A power bank — a big one</h2>
<p>For charging phones when you don't have mains or the van electrics are doing other work. A 20,000mAh bank charges a phone five or six times and keeps things going on longer trips when the solar isn't doing much.</p>
<p><span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Amazon "> Anker 737 Power Bank 24000mAh  ↗</span></p>
<p>One with USB-C Power Delivery is worth the small premium — charges modern phones and laptops significantly faster.</p>
<hr />
<h2>10. An extending squeegee mop</h2>
<p>For the van floor. A week's worth of mud, sand and general outdoor living builds up fast on van flooring. A compact mop that extends to floor level — not a full-size domestic mop — lets you clean properly without having to get on your hands and knees. Combine with a small spray bottle of floor cleaner diluted in water.</p>
<p><span class="affiliate-ph" title="Affiliate link placeholder: Amazon "> Extendable Mop with Spray  ↗</span></p>
<hr />
<h2>Things that almost made this list</h2>
<p><strong>Gaffer tape</strong> — Solves approximately 40% of van problems. A single roll lasts years. Add it.</p>
<p><strong>A spare bulb and fuse kit</strong> — Costs almost nothing. Saves a trip to a garage in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>Thermal blind set</strong> — If you're in a build without bespoke window coverings, a reflective thermal blind set for all windows keeps the van cool in summer, warmer in winter and gives you privacy anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>A small toolbox</strong> — Screwdriver, pliers, zip ties, jubilee clips. Enough to deal with most minor mechanical or conversion issues without needing a garage.</p>
