    <p class="hero__sub">CamperDNA uses affiliate links to cover its costs. Here's exactly how that works, what it means for you, and why it doesn't affect our recommendations.</p>

    <h2>The short version</h2>
<p>CamperDNA earns money through affiliate links. When you click a labelled link on this site and make a purchase, we receive a small commission. This costs you nothing extra.</p>
<p>We don't charge for the tool. We don't run ads. We don't accept payment for editorial coverage. Affiliate commissions are the only way this site makes money.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What affiliate links are</h2>
<p>An affiliate link is a tracked URL. When you click one and buy something within a set window (usually 24 hours for Amazon, longer for others), the retailer pays us a small percentage of the sale — typically 3–8% depending on the category and retailer.</p>
<p>The price you pay is identical whether you click our link or go directly to the retailer. The commission comes out of the retailer's marketing budget, not your pocket.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How we label them</h2>
<p>Affiliate links on CamperDNA are clearly marked. You'll see one of these labels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Affiliate link]</strong> — inline in text</li>
<li>A note at the top or bottom of a guide that contains multiple affiliate links</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't hide affiliate links in neutral-looking text or label them in ways designed to obscure what they are. If a link earns us money, you'll know.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Does this affect our recommendations?</h2>
<p>No. And here's why that's not just something we say.</p>
<p>The CamperDNA tool doesn't have affiliate links in it. The profile it generates is based entirely on your answers — there's no commercial logic influencing what spec you're recommended. We can't make more money by pointing you towards a more expensive van or a particular conversion company, because the tool isn't monetised that way.</p>
<p>The guides are where affiliate links appear. And our approach there is straightforward: we write about things we know well and would use ourselves, and we link to places to buy them. We don't write about things because they have an affiliate programme. We don't change our recommendation because the affiliate rate is better on one product than another.</p>
<p>If we wouldn't put the link in front of a friend asking for advice, it doesn't go on the site.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Which affiliate programmes we use</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon Associates</strong> — for kit, gear, accessories and smaller items</li>
<li><strong>Specialist campervan and outdoor retailers</strong> — where the product is better sourced elsewhere</li>
<li><strong>Insurance and breakdown comparison services</strong> — for the Buying a Van guides</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll add to this list as the site grows, and we'll always disclose new partnerships clearly.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why we're telling you all this</h2>
<p>Because trust is the only thing an independent site has. The moment our editorial decisions start being shaped by commercial ones, the site stops being useful — and you'd be better off on a forum.</p>
<p>We'd rather be transparent about how this works and have you trust what you read than obscure it and have you wonder.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>If you ever see something on this site that looks like it might be commercially influenced and isn't clearly labelled, please tell us.</p>

<p>This page also serves as our formal affiliate disclosure in compliance with ASA/CAP guidelines and Amazon Associates Programme requirements.</p>
